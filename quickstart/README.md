# Quickstart
This directory contains a simplified version of the script that can allow you to get familiar with the concepts of mining open source repositories for security related commits.
This simple file requires 2 external files:
 - json file to contain your API keys
 - csv file of the repositories to search

We recommend working in a virtual environment with the requirements installed.

The script can be invoked with one command line argument:

`python find-vulnerable-commits.py repos.csv`
